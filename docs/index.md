# Library for constructing large-scale cognitive model
Serket is a library to construct large-scale models and estimate its parameters via the connection of modules.
Currently, you can use following probabilistic models and neural network models. 

- Multimodal Latent Dirichlet Allocation
- Gaussian Mixture Model
- AutoEncoder
- Hidden Markov Model
- Speech recognition with language model learning

Serket makes it possible to construct large scale model by connecting these modules.
